# Applied-Machine-Learning---CNN-MLP

A project for my graduate-level machine learning course where we analyzed the performance of convolutional neural networks and multi-layer perceptrons on the popular image dataset CIFAR-10.

## Abstract

Neural networks have recently demonstrated impressive
classification performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
In this paper, we illustrate the performance of two networks - the L-layer multilayer perceptron and the convolutional neural
network on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We experimented with regularization
techniques such as dropout and found that it reduced overfitting
but worsened convergence rates. Furthermore, we discovered
adding more hidden layers to our multilayer perceptron did
not increase accuracy but helped reduce overfitting. Finally, we
investigated the general trends of accuracy as a function of the
hyperparameters, the effects of different optimizers, and which
classes were the hardest to classify.
